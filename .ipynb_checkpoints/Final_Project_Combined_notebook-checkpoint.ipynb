    "We are going to focus on the `prices_adj` dataset as our data and `securities` gives us our sector/subsector labels. `prices_adj` and `prices` are almost the same except that \"prices_adj\" has adjusted the dataset for stock splits (i.e. splitting single shares into several or vice versa, which changes the price accordingly since the company's value doesn't change. E.g. a 2-for-1 stock split means every share now becomes 2 shares, so there are twice as many shares but at half the price so that the total is the same. We don't want to incorporate these large price changes in our model so we only use `prices_adj`). The `fundamentals` dataset includes annual 10-k filings info, but this is not granular enough to be very useful for our models."

Now, we want to think about what sort of questions we want to ask of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most obvious question we might ask is, given price moves of the previous n trading days in a particular ticker or of the broader market, can we reliably predict where the price will go in the next trading session or over the next k days, both as a binary up or down indicator and as an actual predicted price using regression. We can do this by using a sliding window to take samples of days for our features, leaving the price of the next day or the price some number of days in the future as the label or predicted variable. However, it is not clear that many standard machine learning techniques should be very successful at determining time-series trends, thus we also consider doing some Feature Engineering, to summarize some of the important time-series information in the windows as features to aid in classification/regression. We will explore this later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we look at an arguably simpler, or at least more straight-forward, machine learning application of classifying companies by their corresponding sector labels using the price changes as the data. We will explore classification using supervised learning via Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes', and Random Forest, dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis, as well as experimenting with hierarchical clustering to see if we can identify sub-industry splits as well as groupings of similar sectors."

    "We want observations to correspond to single companies, incorporating all of their price moves as features. Our hypothesis is that companies in similar industries will move together more often than not. Thus our initial thought is that Nearest-Neighbor and clustering techniques should be very successful, but we test other methods and compare results with commentary. Ultimately, Naive-Bayes has been the most successful, followed by Random Forest, which may be partially due to the reasonability of the assumption that features for different days are independent (although this is obviously not true for high, low, open and close features of a single day) but also the high-dimensionality of the data and potential influence of outlying days. We test several implementations of Nearest Neighbors classification to mitigate these issues with some success.\n",

    "From a clustering perspective this doesn't look terrible, but not extremely promising. We can see `Energy` and `Utilities` form fairly distinct clusters and there is some separation of the other groups, but there is more overlap. However it is important to note that the feature space is of very high-dimensionality and that the first two principal components account for only ~22.5% of the variance in the dataset, so the one big cluster may separate more nicely than it appears in a higher-dim space. \n",

    "Let's start with k-NN. There aren't very many labels per class so we're probably going to need to keep k fairly low or test other distance based voting schemes. Alternatively we can play around with excluding sectors with poor support and evenly distributing data across other sectors, but we already don't have a lot of data so we might be wary of this. We also may be worried about the high-dimensionality of the data for using k-NN, so we may want to consider dimensionality reduction techniques or tree-based processing using ball-trees or other data structures."

In particular, we hypothesize it may be particularly amenable to the current task given both the high-dimensionality of the data and the applicability of the mutual independence assumtion of features given that each day's moves should be largely independent. This is not entirely valid of course, in that we also expect there to be trends that extend over periods of time and then subside, and furthermore we expect that different features from the same days should be related, so it is possible that using only close-to-close features will fare better in this setting."

    "Naive Bayes' and SVM both produce superb results, reflecting their strength in the setting where for dimension,`d`, and sample size, `n`, we have `d>>n`. In addition, we note that Naive Bayes' is particularly nice because the independence assumption is not violated here (for the most part) and it is very fast. SVM is a bit slower, however it produces the best results under certain conditions, indicating a good deal of linear separability of the of the classes, at least in some higher dimensional embedding."

    "## 3) Forecast the overnight stock price change direction\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to forecast the direction of the overnight price change (between t0 close and t1 open prices) using the historical price and volume data. For instance, we use 01/05/2010's features as the training data and 01/06/2010's overnight price change direction as the training label to fit a model. Then we use 01/06/2010's features as the testing data and 01/07/2010's overnight price change direction as the testing label to evaluate the model. This process is repeated for all the dates available in the dataset. A trading strategy is formed using the model predictions that buys the stocks with predicted positive return at the market close price, and sell them the next day at the open price.  \n",
    "  \n",

Our best results yield a ~50% prediction precision, which is no better than randomly guessing. In the future development, we will try to impelment the similar approach to predict the mid-term (e.g. 20-day) price movement direction."
